# Platform Potential Report

**Project Name:** Every Bite Matters (FeedMore)
**Current Completion Strategy:** ~78%

## Completion Breakdown

| Layer | Completion % | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | 90% | Fully responsive, optimized, and polished UI. |
| **Database** | 80% | Robust schema with user, donation, and delivery tables. |
| **Backend** | 65% | Core Auth and DB helpers active; business logic mostly simulated. |

## Remaining Tasks (The 22%)

1. **Functional Deep Integration**: Replace simulated form submissions (e.g., `setTimeout`) with actual Supabase write/read operations.
2. **Smart Matching Engine**: Implement actual distance-based and urgency-based logic in SQL/Edge Functions rather than frontend simulations.
3. **Live Tracking**: Enable real-time delivery status updates using Supabase Realtime.
4. **Admin Approval Flow**: Implement the verification system for NGOs to ensure food safety compliance.

## Summary
The platform is currently a high-fidelity functional prototype. The frontend is production-ready, while the backend requires deeper integration to shift from "simulated data" to "real-time operations."
